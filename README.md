Conway's Game of life
======

Originally a boilerplate project for learning Jasmine with JavaScript or
TypeScript, through a TDD exercise of Game of Life (GOL).

Visual Studio: Download the typescript plugin and open the jasmine html runner
in your favourite browser (running the tests from within visual studio doesn't
seem to work perfectly).

Grunt: Make sure to have node.js installed (brew install npm), and grunt-cli
(npm install -g grunt-cli). Then just type grunt and the .ts files should be
automatically compiled when changed, as configured in Gruntfile.js
